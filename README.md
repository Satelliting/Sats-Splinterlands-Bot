## How To Install

1. Download Python (3.9.x) NOT 3.10+
2. Download files
3. Convert `.env-example` to `.env`
4. Type `pip install pipenv` into Command Line Prompt (cmd)

## How To Run

1. Open Command Line Prompt (cmd) in folder (or navigate to folder)
2. Type `pipenv install --ignore-profile` to install all dependencies (only needed to be done once after updates or install)
3. Type `pipenv run python main.py`
   These two will be in the `commands_to_run.txt` for easy access.

## F.A.Q.

- How many decks does this come with?
  - At launch, the Battlebase will have over 65,000 possibilities of decks that it searches through. Premium members will be able to access the ever-expanding database that is updated nightly. Some bots will claim to have more, but the Battlebase is all UNIQUE deck combinations, not unique battles _cough_ _cough_.
- Why doesn't the bot prioritize my quest?
  - Currently, the bot only can complete quests that deal with splinters. Neutral, Snipe, and Sneak quests are not accounted for at the moment.
- Do I need to have my account _premium_ to use the bot?
  - No. The bot is free to use. People who upgrade to premium will get access to private files via [Discord](https://discord.gg/v2f9e4DssU)
- The bot is throwing errors, but is still running. Is that normal?
  - The current bot is our first couple editions. There may be kinks we need to sort out, so please send us screenshots and any details you can and we will work to remedy them. Feel free to report Issues to GitHub or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/v2f9e4DssU).
